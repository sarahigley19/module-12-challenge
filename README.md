I was asked to create an SQL Employee Tracker

##  Project Description
This project was fun! I like SQL because I feel like I can see how this would be applied in real life scenarios. I work with a lot of really messed up data at my job and I feel like I could see how I could use SQL in my everyday life. I had some issues with this project but it was mostly just me needing to login and log back out of sql. All in all I'm glad I was able to figure it out.
